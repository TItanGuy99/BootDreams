  <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>There is also support for burning most DiscJuggler 
  images. If you have an image that is in the data/data format and it has CDDA 
  tracks then the image may not fit on the disc because an extra 150 sectors are 
  used between each track burned. Additionally images 
  with more than two sessions has not been tested, 
  but may or may not burn, depending on the image's 
layout.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></body>
