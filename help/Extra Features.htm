  BootDreams will check many things with your selfboot folder to make sure you are 
  not missing anything      
basic.          
              
        
        
</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM><U>Folder Setup</U></EM><BR>BootDreams checks 
  to make sure the selfboot folder has at least one file in it. It also checks 
  to make sure that the&nbsp;one file is not an IP.BIN file.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM><U>Main Binaries</U></EM><BR>BootDreams uses a few ways to try and auto-detect the 
  main binary filename.</FONT></P>
  <UL>
    <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>a file named 1ST_READ.BIN is in the selfboot 
    folder</FONT>
    <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>one file in the selfboot folder and it's not a 
    IP.BIN or 1ST_READ.BIN</FONT>
    <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>two files in the selfboot folder and one of the 
    two is a IP.BIN</FONT>
    <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>more 
    than two files with a IP.BIN (the main binary 
    set in the IP.BIN is used if the filename exists)</FONT></LI></UL>
  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If the 
  main binary is still not found&nbsp;then you have to select it yourself. If 
  the main binary was found but was too long, you will have to rename it to something with 
  16 characters or less.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Once the filename of the main binary is known, 
  BootDreams will check if it is a scrambled, unscrambled, ELF, Katana, WinCE or 
  Naomi binary.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If the binary is scrambled then it will go onto the 
  next step (IP.BIN). If it is unscrambled, Katana, WinCE or a Naomi 
  binary&nbsp;BootDreams will ask if you want to scramble it. Katana, WinCE or 
  Naomi binaries usually do not need to be scrambled because the IP.BIN will do 
  this on the Dreamcast hardware if it had been previously hacked with binhack. 
  If you choose not to scramble the binary BootDreams will still create the 
  image with the unscrambled binary.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If the binary is a ELF, it will ask you to convert 
  it to a binary. If you choose not to convert the ELF to a binary then 
  BootDreams will stop.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM><U>IP.BIN</U></EM><BR>BootDreams does a 
  couple checks to make sure everything is good with the IP.BIN file. First it will make sure 
  it is not missing, and if it is&nbsp;BootDreams will ask you to make one 
  and use the main binary filename for the main binary field in the IP.BIN. If the IP.BIN file 
  exists then it checks to make sure the main binary field in the IP.BIN 
  is pointing to the current main binary auto-detected (or manually selected) and will have you fix 
  it if the field and current main binary are different. If 
  the IP.BIN is not created or the IP.BIN is not fixed then BootDreams will 
  stop.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></body>
